## Easy Platformer
A one-level platforming game where you have to get to the goal!

## Summary

For the project, I used p5 to construct a platforming game. Using shapes and key commands, I rendered an entire level with rectangles and squares. The character moves left and right with the "A" and "D" keys. The goal is all the way at the bottom, and plays a congratulatory sound when reached.
